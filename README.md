## About me

I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I have a background in Design. I transitioned into web development after taking a web design class at Lesley University and being drawn by curiosity  to translate the designs to living and working pages. I had  completed a Front-End Dev course at Udacity  but I decided to dig deeper and signed up for Lambda School's Full-Stack & Computer Science program; now I am looking for my first opportunity to start off my career as a Sofware Engineer.
